Let's assume that initially, the mixture contains 2x liters of milk and 3x liters of water. The total quantity of the mixture is 2x + 3x = 5x liters.

According to the given information, the quantity of milk in the mixture is 40 liters. So, we have:

2x = 40

Solving this equation, we find:

x = 40/2
x = 20

Therefore, the initial mixture contains 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 liters of milk and 3x = 3 * 20 = 60 liters of water.

Now, we need to find the quantity of water that should be added to change the milk-water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11.

Let's assume we need to add y liters of water to achieve the desired ratio. After adding y liters of water, the new quantity of water in the mixture will be 60 + y liters.

The new ratio of milk to water will be 40: (60 + y).

According to the given ratio, we have:

40 / (60 + y) = 4 / 11

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4(60 + y) = 40 * 11

240 + 4y = 440

4y = 440 - 240
4y = 200

y = 200 / 4
y = 50

Therefore, to change the milk-water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11 in a mixture initially containing 40 liters of milk, 50 liters of water should be added.



ANS-2

To find the points where the linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 intersects the x-axis and the y-axis, we can substitute the corresponding variables with zero and solve for the other variable.

To find the point where the equation intersects the x-axis, we substitute y = 0:

2x + 3(0) = 0

2x = 0

x = 0

So, the point of intersection with the x-axis is (0, 0).

To find the point where the equation intersects the y-axis, we substitute x = 0:

2(0) + 3y = 0

3y = 0

y = 0

Therefore, the point of intersection with the y-axis is also (0, 0).

Hence, the linear equation 2x + 3y = 0 intersects both the x-axis and the y-axis at the origin (0, 0).


ANS-3

In the Question The equation should be a^2 - b^2 = 19 instead of a^2 - b^ = 19in the Question.

Now, let's proceed with solving the corrected equation.

We can factorize the equation a^2 - b^2 = 19 using the difference of squares formula:

(a - b)(a + b) = 19

Since a and b are positive integers, the factors (a - b) and (a + b) must also be positive integers.

Now, let's consider the possible factor pairs of 19:

1 * 19
-1 * -19

Since the factors should add up to a positive number (a + b), the only possible pair is:

1 * 19

This means we have:

a - b = 1 ...(1)
a + b = 19 ...(2)

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:

2a = 20

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

a = 10

Substituting the value of a in equation (2), we can solve for b:

10 + b = 19

b = 19 - 10
b = 9

Therefore, the values of a and b that satisfy the equation a^2 - b^2 = 19 are a = 10 and b = 9.


ANS-4

(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

Given that a + b + c = 5 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10, we can substitute these values into the identity:

(5)(10 - ab - ac - bc) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

Expanding the left side:

50 - 5ab - 5ac - 5bc = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

Now, we need to find the value of ab, ac, and bc. To do that, we can square the equation a + b + c = 5:

(a + b + c)^2 = 5^2

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 25

Substituting a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10:

10 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 25

2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 15

Dividing both sides by 2:

ab + ac + bc = 7.5

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation we obtained earlier:

50 - 5(7.5) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

50 - 37.5 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

12.5 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc

Therefore, the value of a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc is 27.5.

ANS-5


Let's assume the first two-digit number is represented by the digits "xy," where x and y are consecutive positive integers. Therefore, the digits can be either 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, or 89.

When the digits of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. So, the second number can be represented by the digits "yx."

Now, let's find the sum of these two-digit numbers and check if it is a perfect square.

For the first case, where the digits are 12:
12 + 21 = 33, which is not a perfect square.

For the second case, where the digits are 23:
23 + 32 = 55, which is a perfect square (55 = 5^2).

Therefore, the two-digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions are 23 and 32.

To find the square root of their sum:
23 + 32 = 55
√55 ≈ 7.41619848709

Hence, the two-digit numbers are 23 and 32, and the square root of their sum is approximately 7.41619848709.
